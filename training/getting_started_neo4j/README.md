# Getting started with Neo4j

In this workshop, you will learn how to setup a Neo4j environment and how to interact with it using Cypher and Python.

This will be useful to start using Neo4j in our software "Gocod".

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Docker concepts and commands

## Neo4j Setup with Docker

Please follow the instructions in the [1-docs.md](1-docs.md) file to setup your Neo4j environment.

After each workshop, get back to the [1-docs.md](1-docs.md) file to setup your environment for the next workshop.
## Workshop 1: Neo4j Basics

**Objective:** 

Understand the basics of Neo4j and how to interact with it using the Neo4j cypher.

**Instructions**: 

Once, you have your Neo4j environment up and running, you can start the first workshop open the file [2-Neo4j-basics.md](2-Neo4j-basics.md) and follow the instructions.

## Workshop 2: Neo4j with Python

**Objective:**

Understand how to interact with Neo4j using Python.

**Instructions**:

Run a jupyterlab container using those [instructions](1-docs.md#connect-to-jupyter-using-the-service-jupyter).

Once, you have your jupyter environment up and running(following the docs.md instructions), you can start the second workshop open the file [3-neo4j-python.ipynb](3-neo4j-python.ipynb) in jupyterlab and follow the instructions.
